                    <p>TYPE: Mammals</p>
                    <p>DIET: Herbivore</p>
                    <p>GROUP NAME: Herd</p>
                    <p>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD: Up to 70 years</p>
                    <p>SIZE: Height at the shoulder: 8.2 to 13 feet</p>
                    <p>WEIGHT: 2.5 to 7 tons</p>
                    <p>
                        African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are slightly larger than their Asian cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa. (Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool, but sometimes the African heat is too much. Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves. Afterwards, they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An elephant's trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for grabbing thingsâ€”especially a potential meal. The trunk alone contains about 100,000 different muscles. African elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items. (Asian elephants have one.)
