                        John Clayton, also known by his formal title of Lord Greystoke, works for the British Colonial Office. He is sent to 
                        British West Africa on a business trip. Lord Greystoke and his young wife, Alice Clayton, sail to Africa in 1888. They 
                        arrive in Freetown a month later, where they charter a small ship called the Fuwalda to take them to their new home.

                    <p class="">
                        Just hours after the British vessel disappears over the horizon, Lord Greystoke and Lady Alice learn there is to be 
                        a mutiny (or rebellion) against the officers of the ship.
                    </p>
                    <p class="">
                        After the mutiny, Black Michael, the new captain of the ship, tells the Claytons they will disembark with all their 
                        belongings and stay there for a few. Then he'll notify the British government of the Claytons' whereabouts, so they 
                        can be rescued. Lord Greystoke doesn't like this idea at all, but his protests only anger Black Michael, so he is forced 
                        to go along with the plan. All their belongings, including their revolvers, are brought to shore, as well as a supply of 
                        food, tools, and cooking utensils.

                        John uses the rope and sails left by the crew of the Fuwalda, as well as a grove of trees, to build a shelter high above the ground. Safely ensconced in it by dusk.

                        Mountain gorillas have longer hair and shorter arms than their lowland cousins. They also tend to be a bit larger than other gorillas.
                        Gorillas can climb trees, but are usually found on the ground in communities of up to 30 individuals. These troops are organized according to fascinating social structures. Troops are led by one dominant, older adult male, often called a silverback because of the swath of silver hair that adorns his otherwise dark fur. Troops also include several other young males, some females, and their offspring.

                        There are five different species of baboons. All of them live in Africa or Arabia. Baboons are some of the world's largest monkeys, and males of different species average from 33 to 82 pounds. Baboon bodies are 20 to 40 inches long, not including substantial tails of varying lengths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Baboons generally prefer savanna and other semi-arid habitats, though a few live in tropical forests.
                        Like other Old World monkeys, baboons do not have prehensile (gripping) tails. But they can and do climb trees to sleep, eat, or look out for trouble. They spend much of their time on the ground.
