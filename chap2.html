                        tribe that harassed the Claytons for the past year, is in a mad rage. He lashes out at his fellow gorillas, killing one of them, and then chases Kala, a nine-year-old female ape who is oblivious to his ire until it's too late.

                        , losing its grip on her fur, falls to its death 30 feet below. Kerchak's fury disappears and he leads the tribe to the Claytons' cabin so he can try to learn more about the big black stick that makes noises and kills inhabitants of the jungle. Kala gathers her baby's broken body into her arms and refuses to let go.

                        The door to the cabin is ajar when they arrive. They sneak in, afraid of waking "the little black stick." The "strange white ape" is lying across the table with his head on his arm and a baby is crying in the cradle. John Clayton wakes just before Kerchak attacks and kills John. Kerchak then turns his attention to the cradle, but Kala snatches the baby from under his hands, trading her dead baby for the live one. She scurries into a tree and

                        The apes go back into the forest after Kerchak examined the “black stick”. Kala joins them but doesn't let anyone else touch her new baby, who seems much frailer and more delicate than the other ape children. She grips him tightly, unwilling to lose another child.
