He finally understands the purpose of letters and words by the time he is 17, and he can easily read and understand each word in the primer. He has growned stronger, he is as fast as a

                    <p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: Panthera pardus</p>
                    <p>TYPE: Mammals</p>
                    <p>DIET: Carnivore</p>
                    <p>SIZE: Head and body: 4.25 to 6.25 feet; tail: 3.5 to 4.5 feet</p>

                        Leopards are graceful and powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars. They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches. By dragging the bodies of large animals aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas. Leopards can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow them to blend with the leaves until they spring with a deadly pounce. These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy movements in the tall grass. When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs and, occasionally, people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leopards are strong swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs.

                        Jaguars are the largest of South America's big cats. They once roamed from the southern tip of that continent north to the region surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border. Today significant numbers of jaguars are found only in remote regions of South and Central America—particularly in the Amazon Basin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These beautiful and powerful beasts were prominent in ancient Native American cultures. In some traditions the Jaguar God of the Night was the formidable lord of the underworld. The name jaguar is derived from the Native American word yaguar, which means “he who kills with one leap.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike many other cats, jaguars do not avoid water; in fact, they are quite good swimmers. Rivers provide prey in the form of fish, turtles, or caimans—small, alligatorlike animals. Jaguars also eat larger animals such as deer, peccaries, capybaras, and tapirs. They sometimes climb trees to prepare an ambush, killing their prey with one powerful bite.

                        The wild boar—which is sometimes called the European wild boar—is the largest of the wild pigs and is native to forests ranging from western and northern Europe and North Africa to India, the Andaman Islands, and China. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is bristly haired, grizzled, blackish or brown in colour, and stands up to 90 cm (35 inches) tall at the shoulder. Except for old males, which are solitary, wild boars live in groups. The animals are swift, nocturnal, and omnivorous and are good swimmers. They possess sharp tusks, and, although they are normally unaggressive, they can be dangerous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From earliest times, because of its great strength, speed, and ferocity, the wild boar has been one of the favourite beasts of the chase. In some parts of Europe and India it is still hunted with dogs, but the spear has mostly been replaced with the gun.
